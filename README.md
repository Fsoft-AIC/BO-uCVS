</div>

## Installation
The easiest way to install the required dependencies is to use Anaconda
on Linux (code was tested on Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS). In this directory,
run
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
The environment can then be used with
```bash
conda activate uCVS
```
Alternatively, the dependencies can be installed manually using 
``environment.yml`` as reference.

## Running experiments

To run the proposed method
```bash
python main.py
```
